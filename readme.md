# Graph Visualization Tool

Tool to create graphs (and modify) and visualize common algorithms result!

This tool revolves around 4 modes: 
```diff
+ visualize mode
+ insert mode
- delete mode
# algo result visualize mode
```
## Visualize mode

</p>
In this mode you can:
- visualize your graph
- mode nodes around
- modify edges weights by clicking on the weight and typing the new one

## Insert mode

![insert-mode](https://github.com/Spiz404/graph_visual/assets/58977203/9d1c31a9-313e-46d4-8538-b15c1e4133d1) 
</p>
In this mode you can:
- insert a new node with a left click
- insert a new edge by right clicking on the source node and then on the destination node

## Delete mode

![delete-mode](https://github.com/Spiz404/graph_visual/assets/58977203/2b613b99-0ab2-4e98-a9e4-4b547297c70a)


In this mode you can delete a node and it's edges by left clicking on it 

Warning! No delete confirmation will be asked before removing, pay attention!

## Algo result visualize mode

If you click on one of the four algo buttons you may have to follow some steps (eg selecting source node for bfs visit)
and than you will get in the result visualization state! \
You can come back to visualize mode by clicking on the esc button.
